# License

*fido2-manage* is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license. See the LICENSE
file for the full license text.

# Supported Platforms

*fido2-manage* should work on any Linux distribution, but we develop and test using Ubuntu. This library is partially forked from [libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2) to provide a FIDO2.1 key management tool under the Linux platform (we already have a solution for Windows).

# Supported devices
FIDO2.1 (PRE or FINAL) keys from any brand can be used. However, with FIDO2.0 keys, no passkey management is possible. As a result, only basic information will be shown with 2.0 devices. 

# Installation
If you haven't installed Git yet, please do so (`sudo apt install git`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Token2/fido2-manage.git

cd fido2-manage

sudo apt install -y zlib1g-dev pkg-config

sudo apt install -y cmake libcbor-dev libpcsclite-dev libssl-dev libudev-dev

rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake -USE_PCSC=ON ..

cd ..

make -C build

sudo make -C build install

sudo ldconfig

chmod 755 fido2-manage.sh
```

### Test the shell script

`./fido2-manage.sh -list`

 ### GUI
The GUI wrapper (`gui.py`) created with Python3 is included in the package and should be ready for use on the latest Ubuntu releases. The only requirement is the tkinter module that can be installed as follows:

`sudo apt install -y python3-tk`

To run the script, execute it using Python from the same folder:

`python3 gui.py`

 


## Automated installation script
You can download the installer bash script to run all commands in one go
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/token2/fido2-manage/main/install-fido2-manage.sh
```


```bash
chmod +x ./install-fido2-manage.sh 
```
```bash
./install-fido2-manage.sh
```

If no errors are shown, then you can launch the GUI:

```bash
cd fido2-manage
```
```bash
python3 gui.py
```


### Usage ###
The syntax and command line parameters are similar to our  [fido2-manage.exe tool for Windows](https://www.token2.com/site/page/fido2-token-management-tool-fido2-manage-exe).

For example, the following command should be used to set a PIN on a new device:
```bash
./fido2-manage.sh -setPIN -device
``` 


### Changes ###
The changes implemented in our fork differ from the original code in the following ways:
* Human-readable command line arguments, consistent with our Windows command line tool
* The ability to send the PIN as a command line parameter
* Displaying the Username (UPN) in the credential output list.

To allow coexistence with the original tool, our version will be compiled and installed under the name 'fido2-token2'.
